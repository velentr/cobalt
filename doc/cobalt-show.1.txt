NAME
----
cobalt-show - show tasks from the database

SYNOPSIS
--------
*cobalt show* ['<options>'] ['@<board>'|'<id>']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Show tasks from the cobalt database.

The *show* command is used for querying tasks from the database and showing
information about the tasks. If no arguments are provided, then all tasks in the
database are shown. If a board is provided using the '@<board>' argument, then
all tasks from the given board are shown. If a numeric task ID is provided with
'<id>', then only that task is shown. At most one of '@<board>' or '<id>' may be
provided.

Tasks are shown in an order that depends on the filesystem implementation; do
not rely on any ordering in the output.

OPTIONS
-------
@<board>::
	All tasks categorized on '<board>' will be printed. The output will
	start by printing '@<board>' (unless '--no-board' is specified),
	followed by the formatted task data.

<id>::
	The task with ID '<id>' will be printed. '<id>' must be an 8-character
	hexadecimal string representing the 32-bit ID of the task (i.e. it must
	match the regex `[0-9a-fA-F]{8}`).

-f <format>, --format <format>::
	Use '<format>' as the format string for printing each task's
	information. Each character in the format string is printed as-is,
	except for escaped characters (e.g. '\t') and format characters (e.g.
	'%s'). Interpreted sequences are:
	\0;;
		nil byte
	\n;;
		linefeed
	\r;;
		carriage return
	\t;;
		horizontal tab
	\\;;
		literal backslash
	\%;;
		literal percent symbol
	%b;;
		board that the task is on
	%i;;
		numeric ID of the task
	%l;;
		full text of the task description
	%s;;
		shortened text of the task description (i.e. up to the first
		newline)

-l, --long::
	Print the long form of the task data when using default format strings.
	Note that this cannot be used when '--format' is specified.

-n, --no-board::
	Do not print the board name before printing task data. This only affects
	behavior when '@<board>' is specified for querying tasks.
