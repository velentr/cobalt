NAME

SYNOPSIS
--------

#include <cobalt/cobalt.h>

#define CO_MAJOR ...
#define CO_MINOR ...
#define CO_PATCH ...

void co_version(int *major, int *minor, int *patch);

Link with '-lcobalt'.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The **co_version**() function is used for retrieving the version of the dynamic
library. The major version number is stored in 'major', the minor version number
is stored in 'minor', and the patch version is stored in 'patch'. If any of
these parameters is 'NULL', then that parameter will not be set (e.g. you may
retrieve only the patch version by setting 'major' and 'minor' to 'NULL').

Additionally, the *CO_MAJOR*, *CO_MINOR*, and *CO_PATCH* macros are defined in
the header file to the major, minor, and patch versions, respectively. These
macros may be used for determining the version of the headers being compiled
against. A program may use these and compare them to the values returned by
**co_version**() to detect if the linked library is older or newer than the
application.

VERSIONS
--------
**co_version**() was added to 'cobalt' in version 0.1 and later.
