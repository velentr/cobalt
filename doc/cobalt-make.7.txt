NAME
----
cobalt-make - build system for cobalt

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The cobalt build system is based on GNU make. The build process is typically
started by calling 'make all', and the files can be installed with 'sudo make
install'. The exact behavior of the build process is controlled by various
environment variables.

TARGETS
-------
*all*::
	Builds the CLI binary, the shared library, and the public documentation.

*install*::
	Installs the binary, shared library, and public header files to
	'$DESTDIR' under '$prefix'.

*uninstall*::
	Uninstalls the binary, shared library, and public header files. The
	'$DESTDIR' and '$prefix' variables must be set to the same value as
	during the install in order to correctly remove the installed files.

*test*::
	Build and run any out-of-date tests.

*retest*::
	Re-runs all tests, including tests that have already passed. This is
	useful for re-running tests under valgrind after the initial tests pass.

*doc*::
	Build all public and private documentation.

*clean*::
	Clean up all generated files.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
*CC*::
	Sets the compiler to use for building cobalt. If none is provided,
	defaults to 'gcc'.

*CFLAGS*::
	Additional flags to pass to the compiler during the compilation stage.
	These flags (if used) should contain optimization flags, architecture
	specification, and (optionally) debug flags. The '-DNDEBUG' flag may be
	added here if assertions are not needed.

*DFLAGS*::
	Additional flags for generating dependency information during the build.
	This should be set properly by the Makefile and is not likely to be
	useful.

*LDFLAGS*::
	Additional flags to pass to the linker during the link stage. Note that
	'CC' is used for the linking step as well, so the flags should match the
	compiler, not the linker (e.g. 'gcc' flags, not 'ld' flags).

*RL*::
	Sets the 'ragel' finite state machine generator to use during
	compilation. If none is provided, defaults to 'ragel'.

*RLFLAGS*::
	Additional flags to pass to the 'ragel' compiler during the compile
	phase. By default, no optimization flags are added; if any optimization
	is needed, add flags here.

*A2X*::
	Sets the path to the asciidoc 'a2x' toolchain to use for generating
	documentation. If none is provided, defaults to 'a2x'.

*DOCFLAGS*::
	Additional flags to pass to 'a2x' during the documentation generation.

*INSTALL*::
	Path to the 'install' binary to use during the installation phase. If
	none is provided, defaults to 'install'.

*prefix*::
	Installation prefix used for configuring where cobalt will be installed.
	If none is provided, defaults to '/usr/local'.

*DESTDIR*::
	Installation destination, in case installation to root is not desired.
	Defaults to empty.

*libdir*::
	Directory under which shared and static libraries will be installed.
	Defaults to '${DESTDIR}${prefix}/lib'.

*bindir*::
	Directory under which binaries will be installed. Defaults to
	'${DESTDIR}${prefix}/bin'.

*includedir*::
	Directory under which header files will be installed. Defaults to
	'${DESTDIR}${prefix}/include/cobalt'.

*VALGRIND*::
	Enable valgrind during testing. This will slow down the tests
	significantly, but will catch more errors.

*V*::
	Enable verbose build mode. In this mode, every command will be printed
	to 'stdout' before it is run.
