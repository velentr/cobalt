NAME
----
cobalt-modify - modify a task's attributes and data

SYNOPSIS
--------
*cobalt modify* ['<options>'] '<id>' ['@<destination>'|'--delete'|'--edit']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Modify task attributes and data in the database.

The *modify* command is used to edit and delete tasks from the database. The
'<id>' argument is required to specify which task to modify. One of
'@<destination>', '--delete', or '--edit' must be specified as well. The
'@<destination>' option causes the specified task to be moved to board
'<destination>'. The '--delete' option deletes the task from the database. The
'--edit' option causes the task's data to be opened in the user's editor, and
the saved result will be set to the task's data.

OPTIONS
-------
<id>::
	Specifies the ID of the task to modify. '<id>' must be an 8-character
	hexadecimal string representing the 32-bit ID of the task (i.e. it must
	match the regex `[0-9a-fA-F]{8}`).

@<destination>::
	Move the task to the '<destination>' board.

-d, --delete::
	Remove the task from the database.

-e, --edit::
	Open the task's data in the user's editor. When the editor is closed,
	whatever data is saved will replace the task's data. If the editor
	returns a non-zero value or the resulting file contains only blank
	lines, then the operation is cancelled and the task is not modified.

-n, --no-gc::
	When deleting a task, do not run garbage collection. Instead of deleting
	the task, it will be removed from all indices in the database and moved
	to the garbage collection area. The data will still remain on disk until
	it is cleaned up by the next garbage collection. Garbage collection may
	be invoked with **cobalt-gc**(1). This option is only valid when the
	'--delete' option is specified.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
The editor used to edit the task's data will be chosen from the *EDITOR*
environment variable.
