NAME
----
cobalt - personal task database and todo tracker

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A cobalt databse is used for storing personal tasks in a plain-text format in a
filesystem-based database. Each task is stored on exactly one board, similar to
a kanban board. Tasks are identified by a random 32-bit identifier and task data
is stored in plain-text files. Tasks may also be referenced by attributes, which
are key-value pairs associated with the task. Boards are a special case of
attributes.

All queries are specified using an index and a set of filters. The index may be
either the task's board, one of the task's attributes, or the main object index,
which contains all tasks.

On-disk format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cobalt database is stored using filesystem primitives (e.g. directories,
symlinks, etc.) to avoid reinventing complex persistent data structures and
in-memory caches. The entire database is stored in the '.cobalt' directory. At
the top level, there are three possible directories.

'obj'::
	All task objects are stored in this directory, along with their
	descriptions and attribute symlinks.
'attr'::
	This directory contains all attribute indices (including boards).
'gc'::
	When a task is deleted, its on-disk object must be atomically removed.
	Since an object is stored in a directory, the only way to do this is to
	**rename**(1) the directory. The destination is the 'gc' directory,
	which can then be cleaned out without worrying about atomicity.

Any of one of these directories may be absent if it is not needed.

Object format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each object is identified by a 32-bit integer or, more typically, an 8-character
hexadecimal string. All 32-bit integers are valid IDs except for 00000000.
Inside the 'obj' directory, each object is stored in a directory that is named
with its 8-character identifier (including leading zeroes, if needed). Inside
the object's individual directory is the task's description and attributes.

'data'::
	Plain-text file storing the task's description.
'attr'::
	Directory containing the task's attributes. Inside this directory are
	symlinks storing attribute data. Each symlink name is the key for the
	attribute. The target of the symlink points at the attribute value
	inside the top-level 'attr' directory.

Attribute format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Inside the top-level 'attr' directory is a directory for each attribute. The
name of the directory is the name of the attribute. Inside the individual
attribute directory, is a directory for each level of the attribute. Inside each
level directory is a symlink for each object that has that attribute at that
level. The symlink name is the 8-character identifier, and the target is the
object's directory under the top-level 'obj' directory.

The level directory is the target for the attribute's symlink within the
object's directory. With this format, accessing the list of objects with a
particular attribute and level is constant-time.
