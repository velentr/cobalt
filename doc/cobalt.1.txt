NAME
----
cobalt - personal todo tracker

SYNOPSIS
--------
*cobalt* '<command>' ['options'] ...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Cobalt is a tool for managing personal task lists using plain-text files. All
tasks are identified by a 32-bit (8 character) hex string and are organized into
boards: each task is a member of exactly one board.

Boards act as an index into the task database, so all tasks on a particular
board can be accessed quickly. Each task is represented by a plain-text data
file that can be edited by the user.

For the tasks that operate on the database, a database is found by first
searching the current working directory for a cobalt database. If none is found,
the parent directories of the current directory are search sequentially until a
database is found or there are no more parents. If the *COBALT_PATH* environment
variable is set, then the search will start at the path specified in
*${COBALT_PATH}* instead of the current working directory.

To get started, read the command section below; to view the options for a
particular command, run 'cobalt help <command>'.

COMMANDS
--------
*add*::
	Add a new task to the database. The task's board must be specified on
	the command line, and the user's editor will be opened to write the data
	for the task. A random ID will be chosen for the new task.

*gc*::
	Run garbage collection on the database. This generally does not need to
	be used.

*help*::
	Print usage general usage information about 'cobalt', or usage
	information about a specific command.

*init*::
	Initialize an empty 'cobalt' database in the current directory. This
	must be run before any other commands.

*modify*::
	Modify attributes and data for a particular task. The task must be
	identified by its ID. Use this command to change which board it is on,
	modify the text of the task, or delete the task altogether.

*show*::
	Show information about tasks in the database. All queries are run based
	on an index, which may be a board or some other attribute. The data
	shown for each task may be customized for easier scripting.

*version*::
	Print version information about the 'cobalt' installation.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
The starting path to search for the cobalt database is taken from the
*COBALT_PATH* environment variable. If no such variable is provided, then the
current working directory is used instead.
