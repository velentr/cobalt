NAME
----
co_add, co_delete, co_gc - add and delete tasks from a cobalt database

SYNOPSIS
--------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <stdint.h>
#include <cobalt/cobalt.h>

uint32_t co_add(struct cobalt *co, const char *data, size_t len, const char
	*board);
int co_delete(struct cobalt *co, uint32_t id, uint32_t flags);
int co_gc(struct cobalt *co, uint32_t flags);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Link with '-lcobalt'.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The **co_add**() function adds a new task to the cobalt database 'co'. The
task's data will be set to 'data' (which is 'len' bytes long), and the new task
will be placed on 'board'. The task's unique 32-bit identifier is returned.

The **co_delete**() function deletes task 'id' from the database 'co'.
Additional parameters are set with the 'flags' bitmask. The different flags that
may be OR'd together are:

*CO_DEL_NGC*::
	Do not run garbage collection after deleting the task. If this is set,
	then the task's on-disk data will not be cleaned up until **co_gc**() is
	called, or until the next call to **co_delete**() that does not have
	this flag set.
*CO_DEL_STRICTGC*::
	If garbage collection is run after deleting the task (i.e. *CO_DEL_NGC*
	is not set), pass the *CO_GC_STRICT* flag to the garbage collection
	pass. Normally, garbage collection will not cause **co_delete**() to
	fail; use this flag to ensure that the on-disk data is cleaned up.

In order to keep certain operations atomic, the cobalt database moves deleted
tasks to a garbage heap rather than deleting them. This heap must be regularly
cleaned up to free the disk space used by the deleted task. By default,
**co_delete**() will run this garbage collection pass after the task is removed
from the database.

The garbage collection on 'co' may be run manually with the **co_gc**()
function. The following may be OR'd into 'flags' to change the behavior of
**co_gc**():

*CO_GC_STRICT*::
	Ensure that any errors in the garbage collection propagate to the
	caller. By default, only some errors will be reported. With this flag
	set, if any file deletion during the garbage collection fails, then the
	call will return an error.

RETURN VALUE
------------
**co_add**() returns the 32-bit numeric identifier of the newly-created task. If
it fails to create the new task, 0 is returned (0 is not a valid task ID).
**co_delete**() and **co_gc**() return 'CO_ENOERR' on success, or a different
error code on failure.

VERSIONS
--------
**co_add**(), **co_delete**(), and **co_gc**() were added to 'cobalt' in version
0.1 and later.

--------
